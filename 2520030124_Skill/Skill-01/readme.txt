To install a Linux Virtual Machine, configure GCC, set up a Git repository, create a project structure, understand shell architecture, and build an initial Makefile. Ubuntu Linux can be installed using VirtualBox or VMware. After installation, GCC can be checked using `gcc --version` and installed using `sudo apt install build-essential`. Git can be installed and configured using `git config`, and a project repository can be created using `git init`.

A basic project structure can be created using directories such as `src`, `include`, `bin`, `obj`, and `docs`. The `src` directory stores C source files, `include` stores header files, and `bin` stores executable files. A Makefile can be created to automate compilation using commands such as `make` and `make clean`.

The shell acts as an interface between the user and the Linux kernel. It accepts commands, interprets them, and communicates with the kernel through system calls. Common shells include Bash, Zsh, and Sh. Commands such as `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `gcc` are commonly used through the shell.

The second part focuses on process abstraction, `fork()`, `exec()`, parent-child relationships, process trees, and system call tracing. The `fork()` system call creates a child process from a parent process. The child receives a new PID, while the parent receives the child's PID as the return value of `fork()`. The `exec()` family replaces the current process program with another program without creating a new process.

Process relationships can be viewed using commands such as `ps`, `pstree`, and `ps -ef --forest`. The `strace` utility is used to trace system calls made by programs. Commands such as `strace ./program` can display system calls including `execve()`, `openat()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.

Result: Linux VM, GCC, Git, project structure, shell environment, and Makefile concepts were successfully studied. Process creation using `fork()`, program replacement using `exec()`, process relationships, process trees, and system call tracing using `strace` were also successfully understood.
